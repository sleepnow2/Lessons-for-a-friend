# Problem 1: Guess!
you are tasked with printing to the console "Guess what number I am thinking! it is between 1 and 10!"
Collect the user input and parse it as an integer.

if the user guessed correctly, then you are to congratulate them and exit the program.
if the user did not guess correctly, then you are to threaten them and exit the program.

_hint: google and lesson 1 are your friends. They have examples of getting user input!_

# Problem 2: An odd sum.

You are tasked with getting one number from the user. that number will not be negative.

from there, you have to find out what is the sum of all  odd numbers from 0 to the supplied number.

print your result to the console and exit the program.

ex:
user input = 7
result = 16
user input = 4
result = 4

_hint: This sounds like a problem that while loops are good for_

# Problem 3: The Odd doesn't stop

you are to replicate problem two, except that you will only exit the program if the user says "exit".

_hint: nesting while loops within each other is common_

# Problem 4: A funky pipe

You have a friend, Tom, who is good at welding.
You have a couple sections of iron pipe.
You are curious.
How long of a iron pipe can you make if you are to weld each pipe together end to end?
Tom tells you that in order to weld two pieces of pipe together, the resulting pipe will be one inch shorter than if you just had both pipes.
Maybe Tom is not so good at welding.
Either way, write a program that can help you determine how long the resulting pipe will be after Tom mangles them together.

The first number supplied will be the number of iron pipes you have.
the next N numbers will be the lengths of each pipe in inches.

Report to the console the final pipe size!

ex
input =
3
2
2
2
output = 4
input = 
2
6
5
output = 10

_hint: Don't trust Tom with any welding projects in the future._
